# Summary

This treebank contains data of Southern Hausa, for the Zaria dialect of Nigeria (Southern Hausa).

# Introduction

The Zaria (Southern) Hausa, is a "modern" version of the language where the 3-way opposition (masculine / feminine / plural) has been abandoned in the noun system, and only the plurality feature is maintained, while the feminine gender is kept in the pronominal and TAM system. 

The treebank contains 1,918 sentences and 14,585 tokens.

It is maintained in the [SUD](https://surfacesyntacticud.org/) framework: [SUD_Hausa-SouthernAutogramm](https://github.com/surfacesyntacticud/SUD_Hausa-SouthernAutogramm) and converted automatically in UD.
